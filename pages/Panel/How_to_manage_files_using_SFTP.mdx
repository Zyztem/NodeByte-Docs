## What is SFTP?

SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream. It is similar to FTP but with added security features.

## How to Connect to SFTP

You can use an SFTP client such as FileZilla or Cyberduck to connect to your server. Follow these steps:

1. **Open your SFTP client.**
2. **Enter your server's details:**
   - For FileZilla, go to `File > Site Manager > New Site`.
